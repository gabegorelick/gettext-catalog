# gettext-catalog

> Keep track of extracted gettext strings across multiple files

## Why?

Lots of projects seeking to provide some kind of xgettext-like functionality end up re-implementing a lot of the same
"catalog management" code. For example, the logic to see if a string (really a domain/msgid/msgctxt tuple) is already
in the catalog and if so, updating references, extracted comments, etc.
